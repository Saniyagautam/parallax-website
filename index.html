        <p class="pclass">The cherry blossom, or sakura, is the flower of trees in the genus Prunus or subgenus Cerasus. "Sakura" usually refers to flowers of ornamental cherry trees, such as cultivars of Prunus serrulata, not trees grown for their fruit[4][5] (although these also have blossoms). Cherry blossoms have been described as having a beautiful smell, and are often the inspiration for candles and incense.

            Wild species of cherry tree are widely distributed, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere.[6][7][8] They are common in East Asia, especially in Japan, where they have been cultivated, producing many varieties. The wild Himalayan cherry, Prunus cerasoides, is found in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and parts of China, and is also cultivated.[9][10]
            
            The Japanese word sakura (桜 or 櫻; さくら or サクラ) can mean either the tree or its flowers (see 桜).[11] The cherry blossom is considered the national flower of Japan, and is central to the custom of hanami (flower viewing).[12]
            
            Sakura trees are often called Japanese cherry in English.[13] (This is also a common name for Prunus serrulata.[14]) The cultivation of ornamental cherry trees began to spread in Europe and the United States in the early 20th century, particularly after Japan presented trees to the United States as a token of friendship in 1912.[15] British plant collector Collingwood Ingram conducted important studies of Japanese cherry trees after the First World War.[1

        <p class="pclass">There is often confusion in the classification of cherry trees, since they are relatively prone to mutation and have diverse flowers and characteristics, and there are many varieties (a sub-classification of species), hybrids between species, and cultivars. Researchers have assigned different scientific names to the same type of cherry tree throughout different periods.[17]In Europe and North America, ornamental cherry trees are classified under the genus Prunus, which consists of about 400 species. In the mainstream classification in Japan, China, and Russia, however, they are classified under Cerasus, which consists of about 100 species separated from Prunus. The subgenus Cerasus omits Prunus salicina, Prunus persica (Peach), Prunus mume, and Prunus grayana, amongst others.[4] Cultural and scientific divergences over the classification of cherry trees stem from the lack in Europe and North America of wild cherry trees with large flowers.[18][7].In mainland China, where viewing plum blossoms has been a cultural activity since ancient times, there were many wild species of cherry, but most only had small flowers. The distribution of cherry trees that bore large enough flowers for flower viewing was typically limited to the immediate surroundings of populated areas.[19] In Japan on the other hand, Prunus speciosa (Oshima cherry) and Prunus jamasakura (Yamazakura) [ja], which produce large flowers suitable for cherry blossom viewing and tend to grow into large trees, were distributed much more widely. The development of cherry blossom viewing, and the production of cultivars, is therefore considered to have taken place primarily in Japan.[19]

            <p class="pclass">Many cherry species and cultivars bloom between March and April in the Northern Hemisphere. Wild cherry trees, even if they are the same species, differ genetically from one individual to another. Even if they are planted in the same area, there is some variation in the time when they reach full bloom. In contrast, cultivars are clones propagated by grafting or cutting, so each tree of the same cultivar planted in the same area will come into full bloom all at once due to their genetic similarity.[21]

                Some wild species, such as Edo higan and the cultivars developed from them, are in full bloom before the leaves open. Yoshino cherry became popular for cherry-blossom viewing because of these characteristics of simultaneous flowering and blooming before the leaves open; it also bears many flowers and grows into a large tree. Many cultivars of the Sato-zakura group, which were developed from complex interspecific hybrids based on Oshima cherry, are often used for ornamental purposes. They generally reach full bloom a few days to two weeks after Yoshino cherry does.[22]
                
                The flowering time of cherry trees is thought to be affected by global warming and the heat island effect of urbanization. According to the record of full bloom dates of Prunus jamasakura (Yamazakura) [ja] in Kyoto, Japan, which has been recorded for about 1200 years, the time of full bloom was relatively stable from 812 to the 1800s. After that, the time of full color rapidly became earlier, and in 2021, the earliest full bloom date in 1200 years was recorded. The average peak bloom day in the 1850s was around April 17, but by the 2020s, it was April 5; the average temperature rose by about 3.4 °C (6.1 °F) during this time. According to the record of full bloom dates of the Yoshino cherry in the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., the bloom date was April 5 in 1921, but it was March 31 in 2021. These records are consistent with the history of rapid increases in global mean temperature since the mid-1800s.[23][24]
